## ClinGen/CGC/VICC Oncogenicity SOP

This section will introduce the Standards for the classification of pathogenicity of somatic variants in cancer (oncogenicity)[@Horak2022].

## Knowledgebases

This section will introduce relevant resources for Somatic Cancer variant interpretation including [COSMIC](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic), [ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/), [oncoKB](https://www.oncokb.org/), others.
