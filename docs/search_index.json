Largely automated pipelines exist to process these raw data, detect various types of molecular alterations (or variants), filter and review to identify high-confidence calls, and annotate these variants for functional significance. However, a major bottleneck remains at the variant interpretation stage. Genome analysts, molecular pathologists, clinical geneticists, laboratory geneticists and others are faced with a deluge of variants of potential relevance (Good et al. 2014). These variants must be manually reviewed and intersected with a vast ecosystem of knowledgebases and biomedical literature to provide current interpretation of their relevance for clinical application. 1.2 Target Audience The course is intended for anyone seeking a better understanding of current best practices in somatic cancer variant interpretation. This might include clinical geneticists, laboratory geneticists, molecular pathologists, oncologists, or other cancer care providers or cancer researchers. 1.3 Curriculum This course will teach learners to: Understand key concepts of somatic cancer variant interpretation Introduce key SOPs and guidelines for classifying the clinical relevance and oncogenicity of somatic cancer variants Introduce ClinGen Somatic Cancer efforts Describe somatic variant knowledgebases Introduce CIViC as a curation platform for somatic variant interpretation References "],["introduction-to-somatic-variants.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction to Somatic Variants 2.1 Learning Objectives 2.2 The Bottleneck Problem in Cancer Variant Interpretation 2.3 Sequencing Background 2.4 Common Variant Types 2.5 Variant Representation and Classification", " Chapter 2 Introduction to Somatic Variants 2.1 Learning Objectives This chapter will cover: Somatic Variant Interpretation Bottleneck Problem Next Generation Sequencing Techniques Human Genome Reference Common Variant Types Variant Representation 2.2 The Bottleneck Problem in Cancer Variant Interpretation As next generation, massively parallel sequencing of tumor genomes has become integrated into clinical practice, a so-called bottleneck problem has arisen, where a large number of somatic tumor sequence variants need to be interpreted for their potential clinical impact. In order to address this problem, databases containing information on the clinical impact of tumor variants have been created. These databases may be the result of private efforts and siloed for use by a particular group. Some efforts curate knowledgebases available to the community with access fees that go towards funding further curation. Yet another model is to create free public knowledgebases for variant clinical interpretation which leverage public curation and expert moderation. The biomedical literature has grown exponentially, including literature reporting new variants in cancer. This compounds the variant interpretation bottleneck as the number of variants in need of interpretation is not only large but also ever growing. The Genomic landscape of many tumor types has been explored, with the number of coding variants in a tumor type ranging from a few to thousands. Individuals carry an inherited diploid genotype, referred to as germline, shared across all cells, containing common and rare variants relative to the human population. Individual cells in the body also develop spontaneous mutations, which are called somatic variants. Regularly dividing cells are especially susceptible to acquiring somatic mutations over the lifetime of an organism. As cells accumulate somatic mutations, they can become susceptible to precancerous or cancerous transformation. This is generally the result of mutations which disrupt the function of Tumor Suppressor genes, which are genes whose protein product functions within cells to regulate and halt the cell cycle, induce cellular differentiation, promote cell death via apoptosis, or other mechanisms which control cellular potential for malignancy. Cancer driving, or oncogenic mutations to tumor suppressors are generally of a reduced function or loss of function (LOF) type. Mutations may also promote cancer transformation via the activation of oncogenes, which are genes whose protein product is usually involved in promoting cellular growth in a regulated fashion, and can help drive uncontrolled growth when regulation is removed. Oncogenes are often part of growth signaling pathways such as those involving MAP or AKT kinases. A key phenomenon often observed with activation of oncogenes is termed oncogene addiction. This describes a phenomena whereby an activated oncogene drives uncontrolled cellular proliferation, but the cells become “addicted” to the presence of this oncogene, in that survival is dependent on its presence. This can be demonstrated with studies where knockdown of the oncogene, or inhibition of its function via inhibitors, induces cellular death. Oncogene addiction of driver mutations is a key mechanism explored in personalized cancer therapeutics, where the discovery of activated oncogenes in a tumor via sequencing opens up the possibility of targeted therapy for the patient. A third class of mutations key to cancer treatment are resistance mutations. These mutations typically arise during drug treatment and often interfere with the ability for a drug to bind effectively to its target. Drug resistance may also be induced by mutations or alterations to cancer cells that activate other pathways, circumventing the drug’s effectiveness. The final major class of variants found in somatic tumors are passenger, or benign mutations. These variants may induce no important change to cellular behavior, or induce changes to the cell that play no role in promoting tumor formation, growth, survival, or any other hallmarks associated to cancer. Tumor variants may be hard to detect due to having low allelic fractions and tumor heterogeneity, making variants difficult to distinguish from noise in the assays. Contamination from normal tissue also contributes to this effect. Further difficulties in detection arise from degradation associated to sample storage methods such as when working with formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. 2.3 Sequencing Background Genome sequencing work performed over multiple decades allowed for the first iteration of the human genome reference in the early 2000s(Eric S. Lander et al. 2001), followed by sequencing of the first tumor genome(Ley et al. 2008). This work has been greatly aided by the introduction of next generation sequencing (NGS). NGS techniques scale up sequencing to massively parallel processes, numbering in the millions. NGS has largely been performed using techniques based on short-read generation (e.g., 150 bp). These short reads are aligned to a reference genome for analysis and discovery of variants in the sample. New technologies now utilize long multi-kilobase reads, and these platforms can sometimes be used for de novo assembly approaches, without alignment to a reference. These long read techniques allow for long-range haplotype analysis. Short read technologies typically utilize a sequencing by synthesis (SBS) approach, which involves reading millions of parallel sequencing reactions utilizing fluorescent-labeled nucleotides during the synthesis of a complementary DNA strand to a short fragment. Due to advantages in cost and throughput, short read sequencing is currently predominant in clinical applications. Therefore, clinical workflows to analyze NGS tumor data involve alignment to a reference genome followed by application of variant calling algorithms. Alignment data can be viewed using applications such as IGV (see Figure). Alignment algorithms allow identification of a range of different classes of variants. 2.3.1 Human Genome Reference The human genome reference most commonly used, at present, is provided by the Genome Reference Consortium (GRC). The official name for the current GRC human reference genome is Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 38. It is unofficially called hg38 in some resources. This reference has high base-pair accuracy and good representation of repetitive and segmentally duplicated genomic regions. The assembly was generated with Sanger sequencing methods and large insert BAC clones (&gt;150 kb inserts). DNA from multiple donors was used. The haplotypes from the different donors create different regions whose borders coincide with the underlying clone boundaries. 2.4 Common Variant Types The variant types usually encountered when sequencing tumors are listed below. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) are a change of a single nucleotide in DNA, and are the most common variant found. In cancer, tumor (somatic) SNVs are best detected in comparison to a sample of germline DNA obtained using normal tissue from the same patient. SNVs are also present as natural variation in the germline among individuals and different human populations. Common germline variation is considered to be at a rate of approximately 1% or higher. In protein coding regions, SNVs can result in silent, missense, or nonsense mutations. Silent mutations alter the codon in a way that results in the same amino acid being produced (e.g. CCA and CCG both result in Proline). These mutations usually do not effect cell behavior unless the altered region has a secondary regulatory function. Missense mutations are changes in protein structure that replace one amino acid with another. These mutations are usually denoted with the notation A123B, where A is the original amino acid, 123 is the position of the amino acid in the protein, and B is the new amino acid change. The consequences of missense mutations range from minimal passenger mutations to oncogenic driver mutations (e.g. EGFR L858R). Missense mutations may also introduce premature stop codons (e.g. TGC -&gt; TGA). This results in a nonsense mutation. The consequences of nonsense mutations are usually a large or complete loss of protein function, as all parts of the protein downstream of the premature stop are no longer translated. Small insertions and deletions (indels) are the second most common form of mutation found both in tumors, and occurring as germline variation in the human population. Indels are usually considered to be insertions and deletions of 50 base pairs or less. In protein coding regions, indels can generate in-frame changes to the amino acid structure of a protein when the insertion or deletion is a multiple of three base pairs, resulting in the addition or loss of one amino acid per three base pairs but preserving the coding frame of downstream bases. Indels can also result in frameshift mutations when the insertion or deletion in a coding region is not a multiple of three. These mutations alter the reading frame, resulting in a radical change to the amino acid sequence downstream of the mutation, usually resulting in protein termination and a non-functional protein product. Translocations and fusions are a relatively common variant type found in cancer. Translocations are exchanges of large regions of DNA between different chromosomes, or between different regions of the same chromosome. Translocations may have breakpoints that occur in the middle of two different genes, resulting in fusions that have exons from both genes. A well known fusion results from the Philadelphia Chromosome (Rowley 1973), which forms when chromosome 9 and chromosome 22 break and exchange large regions. This results in a fusion protein consisting of parts of the BCR gene and the ABL1 kinase gene, including the active kinase domain. The presence of BCR causes tetramer formation, which in turn activates the ABL1 kinase in a disregulated manner, driving oncogenic tyrosine kinase signaling. This fusion drives Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and is a driver that occurs in other cancer types as well. Targeted therapies against BCR::ABL1, such as imatinib, have been developed as a result of the discovery of this fusion and its driver properties (Mughal et al. 2016). A different type of genomic variant consists of copy number variants (CNVs) or copy neutral loss of heterogeneity (CNLOH). Copy number variants consist of losses or gains of large regions of chromosomes. Losses are usually deletions of genomic regions, and gains are usually two or larger fold duplications of genomic regions. These sorts of variants effect large numbers of genes and play a role in cancer. CNLOH usually results from the replacement of a large stretch of DNA on a chromosome with the same stretch of DNA derived from the homologous chromosome in the same cell. This causes a loss of heterozygosity as all DNA in this region is now identical between both homologous chromosomes, but there is no change in copy number of the genes in this region since there were no losses or gains in the DNA of this region. 2.5 Variant Representation and Classification There are multiple ways to represent, describe, name, and disambiguate variants. Resources like the ClinGen Allele Registry attempt to provide an unambiguous central resource defining particular variants, both at the level of exact DNA changes referencing specific genome build, and at more general levels such as protein changes (e.g. EGFR L858R). The Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) provides another widely adopted solution, which is a nomenclature for the representation of variants which is both human readable and also offers exact information on the variant. For germline variant classification, a set of robust processes, data models, and guidelines have been developed. However, with the increased adoption of tumor sequencing in clinical practice, a parallel set of resources for interpretation of somatic variants are equally important. Systems for classifying germline variant pathogenicity, such as those developed by ACMG and AMP, have been adopted and have influenced subsequent developments for somatic variants. Key differences exist between these two areas of variant interpretation and classification, both in biology and clinical actionability. In germline variant interpretation, emphasis is placed on the causal relation between the gene’s variants and the associated disease. When these relations are not well defined, clinical action related to the variant is not escalated. In contrast, in somatic variants, while the causal underlying cancer biology of a variant is of clear interest, in clinical application the observation of variant actionability is prioritized above clear knowledge of disease mechanisms. If a variant is shown to induce tumor sensitivity to a certain drug, this will escalate and expand testing of the drug against the variant, and increase clinical adoption of the drug. Studies of the underlying biology will follow and deepen mechanistic understanding and guide the development of further drugs and potential variants, but may not directly influence clinical decisions. Another key difference occurs in the biology of germline and somatic tumor variants. Many somatic variants found in tumors would be embryonic lethal if they occurred in the germline. In bioinformatics a common file type used for variant representation is the Variant Call Format (VCF) which is a specific file format for storing gene sequence variations. This format developed during large scale sequencing and genotyping projects such as the 1000 Genomes Project or the newer gnomAD database of variant frequencies in the human population (Chen et al. 2022). The VCF format is flexible and allows for representation of many different variant types including those described above. A problem in variant representation in VCF files and other areas of bioinformatics is the non unique way variants can be described. The same variant can be described using reference and alternate alleles of different length and position relative to the reference genome. Different methods attempt to define rules for consistent alignment and parsimony of the variant representation (Tan, Abecasis, and Kang 2015). The particular rules for a parsimonious and consistently aligned variant representation are described in various online resources such as this wiki page: https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/Variant_Normalization.

The main categories of clinical actionability are Predictive/Therapeutic, Diagnostic, and Prognostic. Predictive/Therapeutic evidence about a variant is associated to drug sensitivity induced by the variant in the tumor. This sets up the potential for targeted therapy, where in the ideal scenario, cells carrying the somatic variant are sensitized to drug treatment, but cells without the variant are unaffected. This model exploits the oncogene addiction mechanism, where inhibiting activity of a driver mutation will induce cell death. In reality, off target effects will often be induced due to a wider spectrum of inhibition by the drug, which is usually against kinase activity, as well as other off target biological effects. Prognostic evidence associated to a variant captures the general effect of a variant on patient outcome, ideally independent of treatment type. If it is seen within a general population of patients with a certain cancer type, that patients with a given variant do better (or worse) than patients without the variant, then this would be evidence supporting a positive (or negative) prognostic effect of the variant in this disease type. Diagnostic evidence captures the role a variant in distinguishing disease subtypes. Governing bodies such as the World Health Organization (WHO) produce guidelines for disease classification which often incorporate the presence or absence of specific variants as diagnostic inclusion or exclusion criteria. 3.3 Somatic Functional and Oncogenic Evidence Distinction The discussion of functional evidence and oncogenic evidence in the next section will closely mirror the way these types of evidence are handled in the CIViC knowledgebase (Danos et al. 2019), which will be discussed in a later chapter. Other knowledgebases, such as OncoKB (Chakravarty et al. 2017) make similar distinctions between oncogenic and functional evidence 3.3.1 Functional Evidence and Muller’s Morphs Somatic Functional Evidence is often derived from (or inspired by) the Morphs of Muller, originally inferred from work in fly model systems. This system of functional evidence classification and annotation consists of six terms. Isomorphic variants cause no alteration to the protein function. Hypermorphic variants cause a gain of function (increased function) for the variant. Hypomorphic variants cause a reduced protein function, and amorphic variants cause a total loss of function. Neomorphic variants induce novel function to the protein that would otherwise not be present. These annotations are usually drawn from in vitro functional assays that measure protein activity instead of the effect of the variant on behavior of the cell, such as increased growth, or immunity to apoptosis. 3.3.2 Oncogenic Evidence and The Hallmarks of Cancer The oncogenicity of somatic variants is an additional evidence type that can play an important role in determining the clinical usefulness of a mutation. Variants that are shown to have oncogenic driver potential may also have clinical utility. Evidence is considered oncogenic when it demonstrates that the variant contributes to the appearance of one or more of the Hallmarks of Cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg 2011) in cells. Demonstration that a novel variant is oncogenic can have clinical impact in some cases. For instance if a non small cell lung carcinoma has an unknown EGFR variant, but this variant can be shown to be oncogenic, then existing tyrosine kinase inhibitors established to target EGFR driver mutations are recommended to use. In contrast demonstration of a somatic variant to be a passenger (benign) mutation is also of important value in some cases. For instance the presence of KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer are a counterindication for use of EGFR inhibitors for treatment. But in the case of an unknown KRAS mutation in colorectal cancer, if it can be shown to be benign, then EGFR inhibition could potentially still be recommended.

The AMP/ASCO/CAP guidelines were published in 2017, with the aim of standardizing the interpretation and reporting of molecular results among clinical laboratories. These guidelines focus on the Predictive/Therapeutic, Diagnostic, and Prognostic evidence categories discussed above. The guidelines introduce a system of tiering somatic variants based on clinical knowledge associated to the variant. The tiering system considers the state of knowledge and clinical actionability of a somatic variant within a specific cancer type, along with an associated drug if applicable. Briefly, Tier I Level A variants are established in guidelines such as those provided by the FDA or WHO. For example, in the presence of the EGFR L858R variant, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib is approved for use in non small cell lung cancer, and therefore in this context the variant is Tier I Level A. Tier I Level B variants are those where a reasonable amount of knowledge is present for the variant and disease in the form of clinical trials, but approvals are not in place. If regulatory approvals become established, then the variant will be upgraded to Tier I Level A. Tier II Level C variants are those where the state of knowledge has not proceeded beyond case studies. This Tier also applies to cases where a drug which is established for targeted use against a given variant in a certain cancer type is applied against the same variant but in a different cancer type. Tier II Level B variants are those where studies have not yet progressed beyond preclinical work. Note that besides targetable driver variants, these tiers can also be applied to resistance variants, as this variant type also appears in guidelines. 4.3 ClinGen/CGC/VICC The ClinGen/CGC/VICC guidelines were published in 2022 (Horak et al. 2022). While earlier guidelines focused on predictive, diagnostic, and prognostic evidence for a variant, the guidelines proposed by ClinGen/CGC/VICC provide a direct, systematic, and comprehensive set of standards and rules to classify the oncogenicity of a somatic variant in a quantitative manner. These guidelines provide a system of codes, each carrying a certain numeric weight. Codes are applied when certain criteria are met, such as preclinical assays demonstrating an oncogenic effect (or lack of an oncogenic effect in the presence of positive controls) for a variant. Criteria also consider population frequency, variant recurrence in tumors, and other evidence. Benign criteria indicating passenger mutation status for the variant are also part of the code set. When all evidence present in literature and databases is reviewed and considered for the variant, then the applicable criteria are applied and summed together to create an overall evaluation of variant oncogenicity. The available annotations are oncogenic, likely oncogenic, variant of unknown significance (VUS), likely benign, and benign.

Some knowledgebases aggregate observations of cancer variants across large cohorts of sequenced tumors (e.g., COSMIC), others document variants observed in patients and classified as clinically relevant for human disease including cancer (e.g., ClinVar). Still others detail evidence and assertions of clinical relevance of cancer variants based on published literature (e.g., OncoKB, MyCancerGenome, etc). Subsequent chapters and companion courses in this series will focus on the CIViC knowledgebase. Here we introduce several of the other key/relevant knowledgebases for somatic variant interpretation. 6.2.1 COSMIC COSMIC (the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer) is a data resource that holds the largest collection of somatic mutations observed in cancers. The COSMIC database combines two main types of data, information curated from multiple sources, and a collection of genomes. Curated information is taken from targeted gene-screening panels, a collection of literature (over 27,000 peer reviewed papers), Metadata (environmental factors and patient history), and frequency data for mutations which takes mutation negative samples into account. The genome based data is drawn from over 37,000 genomes and is pulled from different sources including TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) and ICGC (International Cancer Genome Consortium). 6.2.2 ClinVar ClinVar captures reports on the relationship between human variation and phenotypes. Submitters to ClinVar include laboratories, researchers, and variant interpretation knowledgebases. The majority of submissions to ClinVar involve germline variation, and the ACMG/AMP Guidelines for interpretation of germline variant pathogenicity are supported for submitters, as are in house interpretation protocols utilized by the submitter. Submissions are rated utilizing a review status which varies from zero to four stars. Submitters who provide assertion criteria which were used for variant classification are able to submit with one star status. Groups may apply for Expert Panel status to ClinVar. If this Expert Panel status is achieved, then submissions from the group are rated with three star status. Four star submission status is granted to groups recognized by ClinVar with Practice Guideline status. Submissions that do not meet any of the above are accepted but labeled with zero stars. Submissions may consist of a representation of an allele and its interpretation, or multiple types of structured observational or experimental evidence about the effect of the variation on the phenotype. A somatic variant data model is being developed by ClinVar with various stakeholders in the cancer variant space including developers of the AMP/ASCO/CAP Guidelines, the CIViC knowledgebase (see below), and others, to better accommodate submissions for clinical interpretations of cancer variants. 6.2.3 OncoKB OncoKB is a Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Precision Oncology knowledgebase. The curated knowledgebase contains information on clinical cancer variant interpretations, as well as information on cancer variant oncogenicity. OncoKB uses an in house system of evidence levels for clinical tiering of cancer variants. Specific sets of evidence levels exist for Predictive/Therapeutic, Diagnostic, and Prognostic evidence types. Variant Oncogenicity is classified for variants, along with annotations for gain of function or loss of function. Links to literature are also provided by the knowledgebase. OncoKB provides a list of therapeutically actionable genes (over 165), and over 130 associated drugs, which is organized by cancer type as well as specific alteration. A separate list of genes provides oncogenicity/tumor suppressor classifications, as well as presence of the gene on cancer gene panels such as MSK-Impact or Foundation One (see below). 6.2.4 My Cancer Genome My Cancer Genome gives information on cancer variant oncogenicity, therapeutic implications, and available clinical trials. Curated assertions in My Cancer Genome are housed in a Knowledge Management System (KMS). The KMS houses the the biomarker, disease, and drug ontology information, as well as the biomarker-driven cancer clinical trials. The KMS also contains therapeutic, prognostic, and diagnostic assertions, along with unstructured content describing pathways and molecular testing techniques. Therapeutic assertions are biomarker, drug, and disease specific. These assertions are manually curated from drug approvals, treatment guidelines, and literature review. The publicly available AACR Project GENIE genomic alteration dataset is used to calculate biomarker and disease frequency data displayed in the overview section. 6.2.5 Foundation One Foundation One provides tests for solid tumor as well as a liquid tumors. These tests take a tissue sample or a blood draw and search a panel of 300+ genes for cancer-relevant mutations. The tests are FDA-approved for discovery of relevant variants for targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or clinical trial options for the patient. An internal knowledgebase is curated and maintained in order to provide variant interpretations along with generated reports.

CIViC Evidence items include a human-readable evidence statement and structured fields which support (or refute) a specific clinical significance for a specific Gene/Variant in a specific Disease context with optional phenotypes. These evidence statements are categorized into six types: Predictive (of drug response), Diagnostic, Prognostic, Predisposing, Oncogenic or Functional. Each have different Clinical Significance values (e.g., Sensitivity, Resistance, etc for Predictive). Evidence is further categorized according to Level (A - Validated through E - Inferential) and rating (1-star through 5-star). 7.3 CIViC Somatic Assertions CIViC Assertions summarize a collection of Evidence Items for a given variant and disease. Furthermore, Assertions associate a guideline based evaluation to the variant within the given disease context. Evidence for a variant can come from multiple types of published reports. For some established variants, evidence will have been published describing preclinical research, case studies, clinical trails, and regulatory approvals. In this case, a higher tier will be applied. For instance, a Predictive Assertion describing the sensitivity of EGFR L858R to afatinib in non small cell lung cancer might receive AMP/ASCO/CAP Tier I Level A, since this treatment is FDA approved for the given variant and disease. Assertions of variant oncogenicity will also evaluate evidence from multiple sources, including CIViC Evidence Items, as well as data reported from other resources such as the gnomAD database of population frequencies. The summation of this collection of evidence will result in an oncogenicity evaluation based on the ClinGen/CGC/VICC guidelines. 7.4 Introduction to the CIViC web interface The CIViC web interface provides an interactive portal for browsing and searching existing cancer variants, evidence and assertions. It also provides a sophisticated curation interface for submitting new evidence or assertions, revisions to exising content, or comments. A brief tour of the CIViC v2 interface is available here: "],["conclusions.html", "Chapter 8 Conclusions", " Chapter 8 Conclusions While some of the earliest forms of cancer treatment in the 20th century focused on targeting fast growing cells, somatic variant interpretations in cancer increasingly play an important role in the clinic, as targeting of specific variants has become a central part of patient treatment. This course has been designed to give an introductory overview of this growing field. Having worked through the course material, readers should gain familiarity with the reference genome, the basics of next generation sequencing, and alignment to the reference. The basic somatic variant types have been described, as well as evidence types associated to somatic variants in a clinical context. Guidelines covering somatic variant interpretation should be familiar to the reader. An overview of ClinGen and somatic variant interpretation knowledgebases has been provided, along with an overview of the CIViC knowledgebase. With this, students should be well versed in the basics of how somatic cancer variants are currently thought about and the impact they have on patient care in the clinic. Subsequent courses under development will cover the use of somatic variant interpretation guidelines and CIViC interface in more detail.
