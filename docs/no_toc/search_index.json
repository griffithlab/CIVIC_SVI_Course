This material was created by the ITCR funded CIViC resource. This initiative is funded by the following grant: National Cancer Institute (NCI) U24CA237719.

Largely automated pipelines now exist to process these raw data, detect various types of molecular alterations (or variants), filter and review to identify high-confidence calls, and annotate these variants for functional significance. However, a major bottleneck remains at the variant interpretation stage. Genome analysts, molecular pathologists, clinical geneticists, laboratory geneticists and others are faced with a deluge of variants of potential relevance (Good et al. 2014). These variants must be manually reviewed and intersected with a vast ecosystem of knowledgebases and biomedical literature to provide current interpretation of their relevance for clinical application. 1.2 Target Audience The course is intended for anyone seeking a better understanding of current best practices in somatic cancer variant interpretation. This might include clinical geneticists, laboratory geneticists, molecular pathologists, oncologists, or other cancer care providers or cancer researchers. 1.3 Curriculum This course will teach learners to: Understand key concepts of somatic cancer variant interpretation Introduce ClinGen Somatic Cancer efforts Introduce CIViC as a curation platform for somatic variant interpretation Introduce key SOPs and guidelines for classifying the clinical relevance and oncogenicity of somatic cancer variants References "],["resources-sops-and-guidelines-for-the-interpretation-of-somatic-variants.html", "Chapter 2 Resources, SOPs and Guidelines for the Interpretation of Somatic Variants 2.1 Learning Objectives 2.2 AMP/ASCO/CAP guidelines 2.3 ClinGen/CGC/VICC Oncogenicity SOP 2.4 Knowledgebases", " Chapter 2 Resources, SOPs and Guidelines for the Interpretation of Somatic Variants 2.1 Learning Objectives This chapter will cover: AMP/ASCO/CAP guidelines ClinGen/CGC/VICC SOP Cancer Variant Knowledgebases and their limitations 2.2 AMP/ASCO/CAP guidelines This section will introduce the AMP/ASCO/CAP guidelines for the Interpretation and Reporting of Sequence Variants in Cancer (Li et al. 2017). 2.2.1 AMP Tiers and Levels This subsection will introduce the concept of AMP Tiers and Levels 2.3 ClinGen/CGC/VICC Oncogenicity SOP This section will introduce the Standards for the classification of pathogenicity of somatic variants in cancer (oncogenicity)(Horak et al. 2022). 2.4 Knowledgebases This section will introduce relevant resources for Somatic Cancer variant interpretation including COSMIC, ClinVar, oncoKB, others.
