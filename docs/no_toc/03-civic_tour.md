## Introduction to the CIViC data model

For background on the CIViC resource and data model please consult the CIViC core papers [@Griffith2017; @Krysiak2022; @Krysiak2022b].

### CIViC Evidence

The core concept of CIViC is an Evidence item linked to a Source (PubMed, ASCO or ASH). CIViC Evidence items include a human-readable evidence statement and supporting structured fields which support (or refute) a specific clinical significance for a specific Gene/Variant in a specific Disease context with optional phenotypes. These evidence statements are categorized into six types: Predictive (of drug response), Diagnostic, Prognostic, Predisposing, Oncogenic or Functional. Each have different Clinical Significance values (e.g., Sensitivity, Resistance, etc for Predictive).Evidence is further categorized according to Level (A - Validated through E - Inferential) and rating (1-star through 5-star).

Evidence is linked to a molecular profile (variant) for a specific gene, disease, and optional phenotype. Evidence is further categorized into 6 types and 5 levels as shown." alt="The core element of CIViC is the evidence item (or EID) which includes an unstructured, human-readable evidence statement and multiple structured elements briefly describing a key piece of evidence from the biomedical literature related to the clinical interpretation of cancer variants.
